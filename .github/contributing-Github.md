## Github Contribution Guidelines

Familiarizing yourself with Github is paramount to teamwork and coordination.

1. No Self Merging
   Please do not merge your own pull requests, even if this means asking for someone to look at your code.
2. Write a Description
   Please explain what your pull request is meant to achieve or fix, no matter how silly or descriptive the title is.
3. 24HR Grace
   Pull requests, barring extenuating circumstance, should remain open for 24 hours before being merged to address last minute changes and reviews.
4. Bikeshed Handling
   If you are requesting small changes to code, please do so using a code suggestion so that users can easily commit the change to the line.
5. No Master Commits
   Please do not commit directly to master.
