## Testing a local Expo Client

This project is built using [Expo-CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) which features the ability to run and locally test your code.

To do this, assuming you have completed prior instructions on downloading a dev environment, you can start the project at any time by running

```expo start```

This will bring up a browser window. You have the option of testing this on an actual phone or an emulator - the choice is up to you.
However, this is not guaranteed to work via browser, though the option exists.

Keep in mind that expo will open a new brower window for each time that it is run and is not free from errors. Sometimes you will need to restart emulators, phone apps, and even expo itself at times.
